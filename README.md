# Summer-Olympics-Analysis-Prototype
This Repository holds a Summer Olympics Sample file and a Procedural Code made in Google Colab to analyse and deduce necessary information out of the CSV
<hr>
It includes a CSV File as a Dataset("summer.csv") and works mainly on pandas library(python3) for data analysis.
The code is available to work on any Editor or IDE of your preference(It would be advised to use the Google Colab Notebook as its directly available with the code)
<hr>
Make sure to use the "summer.csv" file and place the file in correct directory to avoid the "FileNotFoundError"( I have plans to add the try and except statements along with fewer tweaks)
